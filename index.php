         Prevention involves understanding the disease and its transmission, maintaining distance from others, wearing well-fitted masks, practicing hand hygiene, and getting vaccinated. The virus spreads through small liquid particles from the mouth or nose when coughing, sneezing, talking, singing, or breathing. Adhering to respiratory etiquette and self-isolating when unwell are crucial precautions.
